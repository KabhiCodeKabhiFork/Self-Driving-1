# Self Driving Car-2D

**Project Description:**

Welcome to the Self Driving Car-2D project! This project is an implementation of a 2D self-driving car simulation, where the car utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for its user interface and visualization. Under the hood, neural networks with mutations are employed to enable the car to sense its surroundings, identify obstructions, and navigate through traffic.

## Features:

1. **Neural Networks with Mutations:**
   - The self-driving car is powered by neural networks that undergo mutations during training, allowing the car to adapt and improve its decision-making abilities over time.

2. **Environment Sensing:**
   - The neural networks within the car are designed to sense and analyze their surroundings, enabling the vehicle to make real-time decisions based on the environment, including the detection of obstructions and other traffic.

3. **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Interface:**
   - The project comes with a user-friendly interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing an interactive and visually appealing platform to observe the self-driving car in action.

4. **2D Simulation:**
   - The simulation is presented in a 2D environment, offering a clear visualization of the car's movements, interactions with obstacles, and decision-making processes.
